## Code Contributions

We welcome Pull Requests, particularly for bug fixes related to any open issues you wish to address! If you're new to creating Pull Requests, we suggest you check out [this free video series](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Gravatar Hovercards is developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (following [BEM naming conventions](https://getbem.com/)), and is bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). For package management and script running, we use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Development Workflow

The general development workflow is as follows:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`. Make sure your Node version matches the minimum requirement specified in the `package.json` file.
3. Create a new branch, using [the branch naming scheme](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/trunk/docs/git-workflow.md#branch-naming-scheme), e.g. `add/a-cool-feature` or `fix/100-a-bug`.
4. Navigate to the project directory by running `cd web/packages/hovercards`.
5. Build the library in development mode using `npm run build:watch`. This command compiles the code and watches for changes.
6. **In a new terminal**, start a local server with `npm run start`. Now you can modify the code in the `src` folder and test it (or the output formats) in the `playground` directory.
7. Update or add the related types if necessary.
8. If needed, update the relevant documentation such as [README.md](README.md) or [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
9. Commit your changes and check if all the automated tests pass. (You can fix linting errors by running `npm run lint:<TYPE> --fix`)
10. Create a Pull Request with your changes.

### Scripts

### PR Merge Policy

- Pull Requests (PRs) must pass all automated tests and receive approval from at least one reviewer before they can be merged into the `trunk` branch.
- Who is responsible for merging the approved PRs?
    - For PRs authored by external individuals who do not have push permissions, the reviewer who approved the PR will handle the merging process.
    - For PRs authored by contributors who have push permissions, the author of the PR will merge their own PR.

## Release Process

This project utilizes [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) for automating releases across both [NPM](https://npm.im/@gravatar-com/hovercards) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/gravatar/releases). There're two ways to create a new release:

- GitHub Action:
    - Go to [the release action page](https://github.com/Automattic/gravatar/actions/workflows/hovercards-release.yml)
    - Click on the `Run workflow` button
    - Choose the appropriate `Version type` (we use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/))
    - Confirm by clicking on `Run workflow` again
- Local Release (with the push permission): In the root directory, run `npm run release` and follow the instructions.
